## Installation

You can download the pre-compiled binary file in [here](https://github.com/xalanq/cf-tool/releases).

Then enjoy the cf-tool~

Or you can compile it from the source **(go >= 1.12)**:

```plain
$ go get github.com/xalanq/cf-tool
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/xalanq/cf-tool
$ go build -ldflags "-s -w" cf.go
```

Or you can install it
```plain
$ go install github.com/xalanq/cf-tool@latest
```

If you don't know what's the `$GOPATH`, please see here <https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH>.

## Usage

Let's simulate a competition.

 `cf race 1136` or `cf race https://codeforces.com/contest/1136`

To start competing the contest 1136!

If the contest has not started yet, `cf` will count down. If the contest have started or the countdown ends, `cf` will use the default browser to open dashboard's page and problems' page, and fetch all samples to the local.

 `cd ./cf/contest/1136/a` (May be different from this, please notice the message on your screen)

Enter the directory of problem A, the directory should contain all samples of the problem.

 `cf gen` 

Generate a code with the default template. The filename of the code is problem id by default.

 `vim a.cpp` 

Use Vim to write the code (It depends on yourself).

 `cf test` 

Compile and test all samples.

 `cf submit` 

Submit the code.

 `cf list` 

List problems' stats of the contest.

 `cf stand` 

Open the standings' page of the contest.

```plain
You should run "cf config" to configure your handle, password and code
templates at first.

If you want to compete, the best command is "cf race".

Usage:
  cf config
  cf submit [-f <file>] [<specifier>...]
  cf list [<specifier>...]
  cf parse [<specifier>...]
  cf gen [<alias>]
  cf test [<file>]
  cf watch [all] [<specifier>...]
  cf open [<specifier>...]
  cf stand [<specifier>...]
  cf sid [<specifier>...]
  cf race [<specifier>...]
  cf pull [ac] [<specifier>...]
  cf clone [ac] [<handle>]
  cf upgrade

Options:
  -h --help            Show this screen.
  --version            Show version.
  -f <file>, --file <file>, <file>
                       Path to file. E.g. "a.cpp", "./temp/a.cpp"

                       "https://codeforces.com/group/Cw4JRyRGXR/contest/269760",
                       "1111A", "1111", "a", "Cw4JRyRGXR"
                       You can combine multiple specifiers to specify what you
                       want.
  <alias>              Template's alias. E.g. "cpp"

  cf clone xalanq      Clone all codes of xalanq.
  cf upgrade           Upgrade the "cf" to the latest version from GitHub.

File:
  cf will save some data in some files:

  "~/.cf/config"        Configuration file, including templates, etc.
  "~/.cf/session"       Session file, including cookies, handle, password, etc.

  "~" is the home directory of current user in your system.

Template:
  You can insert some placeholders into your template code. When generate a code
  from the template, cf will replace all placeholders by following rules:

  $%U%$   Handle (e.g. xalanq)
  $%Y%$   Year   (e.g. 2019)
  $%M%$   Month  (e.g. 04)
  $%D%$   Day    (e.g. 09)
  $%h%$   Hour   (e.g. 08)
  $%m%$   Minute (e.g. 05)
  $%s%$   Second (e.g. 00)

Script in template:
  Template will run 3 scripts in sequence when you run "cf test":
    - before_script   (execute once)
    - script          (execute the number of samples times)
    - after_script    (execute once)
  You could set "before_script" or "after_script" to empty string, meaning
  not executing.
  You have to run your program in "script" with standard input/output (no
  need to redirect).

  You can insert some placeholders in your scripts. When execute a script,
  cf will replace all placeholders by following rules:

  $%path%$   Path to source file (Excluding $%full%$, e.g. "/home/xalanq/")
  $%full%$   Full name of source file (e.g. "a.cpp")
  $%file%$   Name of source file (Excluding suffix, e.g. "a")
  $%rand%$   Random string with 8 character (including "a-z" "0-9")
```

## Template Example

The placeholders inside the template will be replaced with the corresponding content when you run `cf gen`.

```
$%U%$   Handle (e.g. xalanq)
$%Y%$   Year   (e.g. 2019)
$%M%$   Month  (e.g. 04)
$%D%$   Day    (e.g. 09)
$%h%$   Hour   (e.g. 08)
$%m%$   Minute (e.g. 05)
$%s%$   Second (e.g. 00)
```

## FAQ

### I double click the program but it doesn't work

Codeforces Tool is a command-line tool. You should run it in terminal.

### I cannot use `cf` command

You should put the `cf` program to a path (e.g. `/usr/bin/` in Linux) which has been added to system environment variable PATH.

Or just google "how to add a path to system environment variable PATH".

### How to add a new testcase

Create two extra testcase files `inK.txt` and `ansK.txt` (K is a string with 0~9).

### Enable tab completion in terminal

Use this [Infinidat/infi.docopt_completion](https://github.com/Infinidat/infi.docopt_completion).

Note: If there is a new version released (especially a new command added), you should run `docopt-completion cf` again.
